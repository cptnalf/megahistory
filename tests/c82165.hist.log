During the transfer from CLASIC to WBC the special case handling a paymethod of pay_multiple_of_last_bet and pay_fixed_credits should have updated the hit amount from what the BEII told us because the Bonus cannot know what the actual pay was from the data we have.  Now handle the condition correctly

Previously in CLASIC Bonusing we were comparing paytype, the WBC compares paymethod which are different values.  e.g. Paytype^2 == paymethod.

Now correctly handle these two special pay success conditions.

If there are constraint violations with the existing data, the violation will be logged in a new table, and the NOCHECK left on.  The violation can then be dealt with manually, and the FK check applied to the table.

Essentially in the fix for the Atlantis connection build-up issue I was over cautious in my closing of objects and I closed the TicketRedemption object when it didn't need to be. The Cashable Promo tickets is the only path that uses this object (that is why Cashable Promo's were only affected).

The first time through the cashable promo will validate.  There is then a section of code after the validation completes that calls into the three lines of code that closes the object.  The next time a cashable promo validated the ticket redemption object is null and thus the error.  When you restart the simulator (or client) the TicketRedemption object is re-established and you can pay the first cashable promo again.
